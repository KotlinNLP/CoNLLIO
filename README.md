# CoNLLIO (CoNLL Input Output)

CoNLLIO is a Kotlin library designed to read CoNLL-style data format, turning them into a list of Sentences and Tokens.

It is possible to read the CoNLL-X data format used in the CoNLL 2006 Shared Task and the CoNLL-U data format used in the CoNLL 2017 Shared Task.

CoNLLIO is part of [KotlinNLP](http://kotlinnlp.com/ "KotlinNLP").
